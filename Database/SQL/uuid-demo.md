# UUID

## Intro

https://www.postgresqltutorial.com/postgresql-tutorial/postgresql-uuid/

UUID stands for Universal Unique Identifier and is a standard. A UUID value is 128-bit quantity generated by an algorithm that make it unique in the known universe using the same algorithm. 

UUID is a sequence of 32 hexadecimal digits like

    d5e4c822-ef2b-11ed-9269-00ff9d802ef6

(One hexadeciaml digit occupies four bits and 32*4=128)

Because of its uniqueness feature, you often found UUID in the distributed systems because it guarantees a better uniqueness than the SERIAL data type which generates only unique values within a single database.

## Advantages (compare to int's)

- Easy to combine two tables even from diffent databases. Because there are minimal risk that two UUID's are the same
- The client (e.g the C# or Java program) can generate an ID without needing to communicate with the database (good for performance)
- Better security since it's hard/impossible to guess a UUID

## Disadvantages (compare to int's)

- Occupies more physical space on the harddrive (one UUID takes 16 bytes)  
- Harder to read and remember when debugging and developing 

## Is a UUID unique?

- UUID is made of 32 hexadecimal numbers (128 bits)
- So the total number of UUID's is: 16^32 = 3.4 * 10^38 (34000000000000000000000000000000000000)
- On a paper there are (approx) 10^22 atoms.
- If every person on earth get one million pappers and they start to count each atom => 10^10 * 10^22 * 10^6 = 10^38
