# Project - modeling a database

## Brainstorming

Your group is going to create a database for a company.

Choose three candidates from **Ideas.md** or choose another company.

(10min)

We meet and decide which group to do what. All groups should pick different companies. 

## Analyse

To know what tables and fields to model it is useful to answer these questions:

- How will the company make money?
- Who will use the final app? (e.g customer, sales, service, administrators, accounting...)
- What questions do the users of the app want to answer?

E.g if you model a database for Voi the answer of the first question could be "By renting scooters to customers in major cities". 

Customers want to know
- Which scooters are close to me right now? 
- How much battery is left on the scooters close to me? 
- How much will the trip cost?

Sales want to know
- In which areas do most of our customers ride? 
- How much money did we earn last month? 
- Did the last advertisement become a success?
- How do our customers rate their rides?

Service personnel want to know
- Where are our scooters right now?
- What is the status of our scooters?

## Execute 

Search for
- People
- Things
- Locations
- Events

Spend most of time with the ER-diagram. 

Then create a database.  

## Presentation 

Create a presentation (Powerpoint or similar)

Present your work in 15 minutes:
- Why did you choose this company?
- Explain the process
    * The development of the ER-diagram
    * The development of the database diagram
- Explain the end result (ER-diagram + database diagram)
- Show some detail of the solution that you find interesting
- What have you learned?
- What was challenging? 
- If you continued, what would you do?
