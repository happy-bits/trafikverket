# Bootstrap

It's a frontend toolkit that helps you so you don't have to write a lot of CSS.

You write HTML code and insert CSS-classes that Bootstrap knows about. You can make a nice designÂ without writing a line of CSS. Often you combine Bootstrap with coding your own CSS, which does things that Bootstrap can't handle. (That's why you have to learn CSS from scratch and can't just rely on Bootstrap)

Just as React has competitors like Angular, Svelte... there are alternatives to Bootstrap. A competitor to Bootstrap that might be interesting to look at is TailwindCSS

# History

Bootstrap was developed by Mark Otto and Jacob Thornton at Twitter as a framework to encourage consistency across internal tools. 

The first version was released in 2011 as an open-source project, and it quickly gained popularity. Early on, it provided a set of design patterns and responsive layouts that developers could use out-of-the-box. As it gained traction, the community around Bootstrap started contributing to its growth, which led to more rapid and robust development.
